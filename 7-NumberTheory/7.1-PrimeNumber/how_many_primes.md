# Problem

Prove that there are an infinite number of primes

# Proof by contradiction

- Assume there are a finite number of primes: p1, p2, ..., pn.
- Let `m = 1 + p1*p2*...*pn`.
- Since m is bigger than any of the primes, it must be composite
  -> Some primes must divide it.
- But m leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any of the primes
  -> m must also be a prime - contradicts the assumption
